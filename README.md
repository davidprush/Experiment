# Experiment

This Electron app is for teaching myself web scraping & persistent data with Electron.

## Getting Started

So I think I want to scrape some crypto currency data & store it locally as persistent data--with maybe some CSV export functionality.

## Prerequisites

npm, node.js, electron, crypto-js, d3-dsv, lokijs, osmosis, & nightmare

## Installing

If I package this, I will enter installation instructions here.

## Built With

* [Electron JS](https://electron.atom.io/) - Software Framework
* [npm - "Node.js Package Manager"](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Dependency Management
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code Editor I used -- Of course it is an Electron app.
